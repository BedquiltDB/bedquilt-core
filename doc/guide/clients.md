# Clients

Programs interact with the BedquiltDB server through client libraries. These libraries wrap the SQL core of BedquiltDB and provide APIs which feel native to the host programming language.

There are two officially supported clients (or drivers), [pybedquilt](http://pybedquilt.readthedocs.org) for Python and [node-bedquilt](http://node-bedquilt.readthedocs.org) for Node.JS.

The [bedquilt-examples](https://github.com/BedquiltDB/bedquilt-examples) repository contains two example applications, one for Node.JS and one for Python. The example apps demonstrate the basic usage of BedquiltDB in real applications.
